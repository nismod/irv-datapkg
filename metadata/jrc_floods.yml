data_summary: >
  The global river flood hazard maps are a gridded data set representing
  inundation along the river network, for seven different flood return periods
  (from 1-in-10-years to 1-in-500-years). The input river flow data for the new
  maps are produced by means of the open-source hydrological model LISFLOOD, while
  inundation simulations are performed with the hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP.
  The extent comprises the entire world with the exception of Greenland and
  Antarctica and small islands with river basins smaller than 500km2.

  Cell values indicate water depth (in m). The maps can be used to assess the
  exposure of population and economic assets to river floods, and to perform flood
  risk assessments. The dataset is created as part of the Copernicus Emergency
  Management Service. NOTE: this dataset is not an official flood hazard map (for
  details and limitations please refer to related publications).
