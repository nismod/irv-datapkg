data_summary: >
  The maps depict flood prone areas for river flood events for six different
  flood frequencies (from 1-in-10-years to 1-in-500-years). Cell values indicate
  water depth (in m). The maps can be used to assess the exposure of population
  and economic assets to river floods, and to perform flood risk assessments.
  NOTE: this dataset is based on JRC elaborations and is not an official flood
  hazard map (for details and limitations please refer to related publications).
