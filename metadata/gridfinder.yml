data_author: Arderne, C., Nicolas, C., Zorn, C., Koks, E. E.
data_title: Gridfinder
data_title_long: Gridfinder data from 'Predictive mapping of the global power system using open data'
data_summary: >
  Three primary global data outputs from the research:

  grid.gpkg: Vectorized predicted distribution and transmission line network,
  with existing OpenStreetMap lines tagged in the 'source' column

  targets.tif: Binary raster showing locations predicted to be connected to
  distribution grid.

  lv.tif: Raster of predicted low-voltage infrastructure in kilometres per cell.

  This data was created with code in the following three repositories:

  https://github.com/carderne/gridfinder
  https://github.com/carderne/predictive-mapping-global-power
  https://github.com/carderne/access-estimator

  Full steps to reproduce are contained in this file:
