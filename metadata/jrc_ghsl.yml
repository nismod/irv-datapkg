data_summary: >
  The GHS_POP spatial raster dataset depicts the distribution of residential
  population, expressed as the number of people per cell. Residential population
  estimates between 1975 and 2020 in 5-year intervals and projections to 2025
  and 2030 derived from CIESIN GPWv4.11 were disaggregated from census or
  administrative units to grid cells, informed by the distribution, density, and
  classification of built-up as mapped in the Global Human Settlement Layer
  (GHSL) global layer per corresponding epoch.

  The GHS_BUILT_S spatial raster dataset depicts the distribution of built-up
  surfaces, expressed as number of square metres. The data report about the
  total built-up surface and the built-up surface allocated to dominant
  non-residential (NRES) uses.

  Data are spatial-temporal interpolated or extrapolated from 1975 to 2030 in 5
  years intervals. For the temporal anchor point of 2018 the data is published
  at 10m as observed from the S2 image data.
