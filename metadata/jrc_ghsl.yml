data_summary: >
  The spatial raster dataset depicts the distribution of residential population,
  expressed as the number of people per cell. Residential population estimates
  between 1975 and 2020 in 5-year intervals and projections to 2025 and 2030
  derived from CIESIN GPWv4.11 were disaggregated from census or administrative
  units to grid cells, informed by the distribution, density, and classification
  of built-up as mapped in the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) global layer
  per corresponding epoch.
