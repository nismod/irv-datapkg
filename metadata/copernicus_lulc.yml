data_summary: >
  This dataset provides global maps describing the land surface into 22 classes,
  which have been defined using the United Nations Food and Agriculture
  Organization's (UN FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). In addition
  to the land cover (LC) maps, four quality flags are produced to document the
  reliability of the classification and change detection.

  In order to ensure continuity, these land cover maps are consistent with the
  series of global annual LC maps from the 1990s to 2015 produced by the
  European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), which are also
  available on the ESA CCI LC viewer.

  To produce this dataset, the entire Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
  (MERIS) Full and Reduced Resolution archive from 2003 to 2012 was first
  classified into a unique 10-year baseline LC map. This is then back- and
  up-dated using change detected from (i) Advanced Very-High-Resolution
  Radiometer (AVHRR) time series from 1992 to 1999, (ii) SPOT-Vegetation
  (SPOT-VGT) time series from 1998 to 2012 and (iii) PROBA-Vegetation (PROBA-V)
  and Sentinel-3 OLCI (S3 OLCI) time series from 2013.

  Beyond the climate-modelling communities, this dataset's long-term
  consistency, yearly updates, and high thematic detail on a global scale have
  made it attractive for a multitude of applications such as land accounting,
  forest monitoring and desertification, in addition to scientific research.

  The products are made available to the public by ESA and the consortium. You
  may use one or several CCI-LC products land cover map for educational and/or
  scientific purposes, without any fee on the condition that you credit the ESA
  Climate Change Initiative and in particular its Land Cover project as the
  source of the CCI-LC database. Should you write any scientific publication on
  the results of research activities that use one or several CCI-LC products as
  input, you shall acknowledge the ESA CCI Land Cover project in the text of the
  publication and provide the project with an electronic copy of the publication
  (contact@esa-landcover-cci.org). If you wish to use one or several CCI-LC
  products in advertising or in any commercial promotion, you shall acknowledge
  the ESA CCI Land Cover project and you must submit the layout to the project
  for approval beforehand (contact@esa-landcover-cci.org).
