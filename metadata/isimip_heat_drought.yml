data_summary: >
  The time series of extreme events given by Lange et al has been processed into
  an annual probability of occurrence by researchers at the University of
  Oxford, using the pipeline available online at
  https://github.com/nismod/infra-risk-vis/blob/45d8974c311067141ee6fcaa1321c7ecdaa59752/etl/pipelines/isimip/Snakefile
  - this is a draft dataset, used for visualisation in
  https://global.infrastructureresilience.org/ but not otherwise reviewed or
  published.

  Annual probability of drought (soil moisture below a baseline threshold) or
  extreme heat (temperature and humidity-based indicators over a threshold)
  events on a 0.5Â° grid. 8 hydrological models forced by 4 GCMs under baseline,
  RCP 2.6 & 6.0 emission scenarios. Current and future maps in 2030, 2050 and
  2080.

  The ISIMIP2b climate input data and impact model output data analyzed in this
  study are available in the ISIMIP data repository at ESGF, see
  https://esg.pik-potsdam.de/search/isimip/?project=ISIMIP2b&product=input and
  https://esg.pik-potsdam.de/search/isimip/?project=ISIMIP2b&product=output,
  respectively. More information about the GHM, GGCM, and GVM output data is
  provided by Gosling et al. (2020), Arneth et al. (2020), and Reyer et al.
  (2019), respectively.

  Event definitions are given in Lange et al, table 1. Land area is exposed to
  drought if monthly soil moisture falls below the 2.5th percentile of the
  preindustrial baseline distribution for at least seven consecutive months.
  Land area is exposed to extreme heat if both a relative indicator based on
  temperature (Russo et al 2015, 2017) and an absolute indicator based on
  temperature and relative humidity (Masterton & Richardson, 1979) exceed their
  respective threshold values.

  Population exposure is calculated as annual expected population directly
  exposed to the occurrence of extreme heat or drought events, assuming any
  population directly within the footprint of an event is exposed, but not
  otherwise taking any other risk-mitigating or -propagating factors into
  account.

  Population is held constant at 2020 levels, using the JRC GHSL GHS-POP R2023A
  release, which can be cited as
