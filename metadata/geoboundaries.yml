data_summary: >
  The geoBoundaries Global Database of Political Administrative Boundaries,
  built by the community and William & Mary geoLab, is an online, open license
  (CC BY 4.0) resource of information on administrative boundaries (i.e., state,
  county) for every country in the world. Since 2016, it has tracked
  approximately 1 million boundaries within over 200 entities, including all UN
  member states.

  All boundaries are available to view or download in common file formats; the
  only requirement for use is acknowledgement. When using geoBoundaries on the
  web, put the name "geoBoundaries" with a link back to the website,
  www.geoboundaries.org, somewhere prominent on the page that uses the
  boundaries. This can be a stand-alone link or within a sentence. For written
  works that use geoBoundaries in analysis, cite the PLoS One Publication
  (Runfola et al., 2020).

  Column Definitions:

  - boundaryID - A unique ID created for every boundary in the geoBoundaries database by concatenating ISO 3166-1 3 letter country code, boundary level, geoBoundaries version, and an ID based on the geometry.
  - boundaryISO -  The ISO 3166-1 3-letter country codes for each boundary.
  - boundaryYear - The year(s) for which a boundary is representative. In cases where this is a range, the format is 'DATE-START TO DATE-END'.
  - boundaryType - The type of boundary defined (i.e., ADM0 is equivalent to a country border; ADM1 a state.  Levels below ADM1 can vary in definition by country.)
  - boundarySource - The name of the sources for the boundary definition used (with most boundaries having two identified sources).
  - boundaryLicense - The specific license the data is released under.
  - licenseDetail - Any details necessary for the interpretation or use of the license noted.
  - licenseSource - A URL declaring the license under which a data product is made available.
  - boundarySourceURL -  A URL from which source data was retrieved.
  - sourceDataUpdateDate - A date encoded following ISO 8601 (Year-Month-Date) describing the last date this boundary was updated, for use in programmatic updating based on new releases.
  - buildDate - The date the geoBoundary files were generated.
  - downloadURL - A URL from which the geoBoundary can be downloaded.
  - shapeID - The boundary ID, followed by the letter `B' and a unique integer for each shape which is a member of that boundary.
  - shapeName - The identified name for a given shape.  '' if not identified.
  - shapeGroup - The country or similar organizational group that a shape belongs to, in ISO 3166-1 where relevant.
  - shapeType - The type of boundary represented by the shape.
  - shapeISO - ISO codes for individual administrative districts, where available.  Where possible, these conform to ISO 3166-2, but this is not guaranteed in all cases. 'None' if not identified.
  - boundaryCanonical - Canonical name(s) for the administrative hierarchy represented.  Present where available.
