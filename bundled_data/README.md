# Boundary definitions

Boundaries are derived from Natural Earth Data map units, which separates
countries into largely contiguous units.

These are further split in some cases to minimise bounding boxes, for example
splitting Spain from the Canary Islands or Ecuador from the Galapagos.

This is surely contestable, and is aimed to maximise ease of use for analysis,
not to make any political statement.
